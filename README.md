# ðŸ“ˆ Automated Time Series Forecasting

**Background:** This MVP data web app uses the Streamlit framework and Facebook's Prophet forecasting package to generate a dynamic forecast from your own data. 

Try it out here: https://autoforecast-prophet.herokuapp.com/ (assuming I have not run out of heroku run time on the free tier!)

You'll be able to import your data from a CSV file, visualize trends and features, analyze forecast performance, and finally download the created forecast ðŸ˜µ

**In beta mode**
